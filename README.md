# Sudoku

Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle that became popular in the late 20th century. The objective of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids (also called regions or boxes) with digits from 1 to 9, so that each column, each row, and each subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without any repetition.

A typical Sudoku puzzle starts with some cells already filled with numbers. The player's task is to logically deduce and fill in the remaining empty cells based on the given clues and the rules of Sudoku.

**The rules of Sudoku are as follows:**

1)Each column must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
2)Each row must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
3)Each 3x3 subgrid must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
4)To solve a Sudoku puzzle, you need to apply logical reasoning and deduction. You start by examining the given numbers and identifying any cells that can only have one possible number based on the rules. Then you use these known numbers to eliminate possibilities in other cells and continue the process of elimination until the entire grid is filled.

Sudoku puzzles can range in difficulty, with some requiring basic techniques and others requiring more advanced strategies and multiple iterations of logical deductions. Solving Sudoku puzzles can be challenging, engaging, and a great exercise for improving logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
